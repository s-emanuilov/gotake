# gotake: High-Speed File Downloader

`gotake` is a CLI tool designed to expedite file downloading processes. Engineered for reliability and ease of use, it's compatible across Mac, Linux, and Windows platforms.  
Under the hood, `gotake` employs either standard HTTP requests or range requests to fetch files, the latter enabling concurrent downloads of file chunks which are subsequently assembled to form the complete file.

## Install
Install `gotake` with a simple one-liner. Below are the instructions for macOS and Linux:

### macOS

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/simeonemanuilov/gotake/releases/download/0.5/gotake-darwin-x86_64" -o /usr/local/bin/gotake && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gotake
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/simeonemanuilov/gotake/releases/download/0.5/gotake-linux-x86_64" -o /usr/local/bin/gotake && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gotake
```

## Examples
Launching a download is straightforward with gotake. Here are some examples to get you started:

### Quick download (auto find optimal connections amount)

```bash
gotake http://sample.li/face.png
```

### Download and print summary

```bash
gotake http://sample.li/boat.jpg -i
```

### Download in verbose mode

```bash
gotake http://sample.li/tesla.jpg -v
```

### Download with different type of connections
